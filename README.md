# Portfolio Website
## Description 

The motive of this project was to create a portfolio for potential employers, to view samples of our work. The application presents the developers name, a photo, and links to contact information and work samples. When the user clicks a navigation link, the UI will scroll to the corresponding section. This project solves the need to type a resume document for future employers. Throughout making this project I learned how to utilize basic HTML and CSS for my personal academic advantage.

Usage

This project is a portfolio application that contains nav bars, sections, buttons, images and links. This project uses advance CSS and basic HTML to give the user a portfolio website that contains an 'About Me', 'Work', and 'Contact' section. The application contains hover colors on some of the headers and also hovers on some of the images. The application is interactive, and the buttons bring the user to the GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. The images under the 'Work' section takes the user to the deployed applications.
