          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h4>Web Developer/Designer/Artist</h4>
          <p>I am a student at the UNCC Boot Camp for computer coding. I am in the process to becoming a web developer. I currently work as a receptionist part time at a wellness and fitness center. I studied at Appalachian State University for two years from 2019-2021. I studied psychology, criminal justice, and communications during my time at University. Outside of my education and career, I am an artist and designer. I enjoy designing logos, digital artwork, and brand content. I am also a painter, and I love photography and videoagraphy. I have a vision for using my artistic abilities and passion for creating alongside my coding and web development skills. My portfolio is currently under construction!</p>
